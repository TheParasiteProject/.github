# TheParasiteProject [15.0 WIP]

Funky changes applied `personal` Open Source OS based on [AOSP](https://source.android.com/),<br/>
which based on various custom AOSP projects,</br>
that add Google Play System Update, Carrier Settings, and features that of our personal tastes :P<br/>
which also focused on bringing more Pixel features into AOSP<br/>
by `Parasitizing` other AOSP projects,<br/>
*`with parasitically manipulated Lineage-SDK.`*

## Build Process

Check these repos for more information.

- [manifest](https://github.com/TheParasiteProject/manifest)
- [vendor_aosp](https://github.com/TheParasiteProject/vendor_aosp)
- [build-scripts](https://github.com/TheParasiteProject/build-scripts)

## Devices

- [TheParasiteProject-Devices](https://github.com/TheParasiteProject-Devices)

## Note

**TheParasiteProject will always be Personal project!**

**Please read each repos' README.md<br>
before proceed to build or ask something to us!**

**This project doesn't support userdebug build spoofing.<br>
As we use userdebug for actual debug purposes.<br>
Please build user build if possible!**

**If you find bugs, or add pull requests to repos but when we didn't noticed,<br>
please report those to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheParasiteProject/issue_tracker)!**

1. This org includes various `experimental` changes<br/>
which may or may not work (although we tested every time when we release it).<br/>
So please be aware about this!

2. And sometimes we wrote weird commit messages if we commit stuffs at dawn, etc. XD<br/>
Though usually we fixes this right after we noticed this by rebase...

3. For anyone who try to build this project, we really appreciate about that!<br/>
But we couldn't guarantee about the stability.<br/>
We've seen many people have build issues or get bootloop on their devices.<br/>
As it's `personal` experimental project, source or feature could be broken in any time.<br/>

4. Also this rom doesn't look that different than Pixel stock firmware<br/>
(as this project's main goal is Pixel like experience).<br/>

5. And most of time, features that released on this project could be presents in other projects.

6. So, instead of take your precious time to build this project,<br/>
we recommends you to consider take a look around other custom AOSP projects!<br/>
(They are really good, seriously.)

In any case, Hope this project helps your projects :)
