# TheParasiteProject [WIP] [QPR3] [Currently Broken]

## Note

**Please read each repos' README.md<br>
before proceed to build or ask something to us!**

1. This org includes various `experimental` changes<br/>
which may or may not work (although we tested every time when we release it).<br/>
So please be aware about this!

2. And sometimes we wrote weird commit messages if we commit stuffs at dawn, etc. XD<br/>
Though usually we fixes this right after we noticed this by rebase...

3. For anyone who try to build this project, we really appreciate about that!<br/>
But we couldn't guarantee about the stability.<br/>
We've seen many people have build issues or get bootloop on their devices.<br/>
As it's `personal` experimental project, source or feature could be broken in any time.<br/>

4. Also this rom doesn't look that different than Pixel stock firmware<br/>
(as this project's main goal is Pixel like experience).<br/>

5. And most of time, features that released on this project could be presents in other projects.

6. So, instead of take your precious time to build this project,<br/>
we recommends you to consider take a look around other custom AOSP projects!<br/>
(They are really good, seriously.)

In any case, Hope this project helps your projects :)

## TheParasiteProject will always be Personal project!

Some minimal changes applied `personal` AOSP based OS,<br/>
which based on various custom roms,</br>
that add Google Play System Update, Carrier Settings, and features that of personal taste :P<br/>
which also focused on bringing more Pixel features into AOSP<br/>
by `Parasitizing` other AOSP projects.
