# TheParasiteProject [No Pixel-FW]

## TheParasiteProject will always be Personal project!

Some minimal changes applied ```personal``` AOSP based OS,<br/>
which mainly based on [PixelExperience](https://github.com/PixelExperience),</br>
that add Google Play System Update, Carrier Settings, and features that of personal taste :P<br/>
which also focused on bringing more Pixel features into AOSP<br/>
by ```Parasitizing``` other AOSP projects.

Hope this project helps your projects :)
