# TheParasiteProject

## Note

This org includes various `experimental` changes<br/>
which may or may not work (although we tested every time when we release it).<br/>
So please be aware about this!

And sometimes we wrote weird commit messages if we commit stuffs at dawn, etc. XD<br/>
Though usually we fixes this right after we noticed this by rebase...

In any case, Hope this project helps your projects :)

## TheParasiteProject will always be Personal project!

Some minimal changes applied `personal` AOSP based OS,<br/>
which mainly based on [PixelExperience](https://github.com/PixelExperience),</br>
that add Google Play System Update, Carrier Settings, and features that of personal taste :P<br/>
which also focused on bringing more Pixel features into AOSP<br/>
by `Parasitizing` other AOSP projects.
