# TheParasiteProject [No Pixel-FW]

## Note
This org includes various experimental changes
which may or may not work (although we tested every time when we release it).
So please be aware about this!

And sometimes we wrote weird commit messages if we commit stuffs at dawn, etc. XD
Though usually we fixes this right after we noticed this by rebase...

Anyways, Hope this project helps your projects :)

## TheParasiteProject will always be Personal project!

Some minimal changes applied ```personal``` AOSP based OS,<br/>
which mainly based on [PixelExperience](https://github.com/PixelExperience),</br>
that add Google Play System Update, Carrier Settings, and features that of personal taste :P<br/>
which also focused on bringing more Pixel features into AOSP<br/>
by ```Parasitizing``` other AOSP projects.
